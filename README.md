# Takeaway visualizer

This project was intended to help people view the food they would order virtually on a table, this is supposed to help those wondering whether they are ordering too much or too little.

## Built using react

I learnt react recently and am still very beginner but decided to learn through this project (and lots of stackoverflow searches).

## Backend using firebase

Currently not using it but plan to in the future by implementing google's firestore.
